This material designs are additional support plugins that fill the gaps where current Angular Material 2 is not covering

Some code/plugins were studied and sourced from other authors:

* **mdl** => Material Design Lite, and a directive created for sourcing from MDL      
* **ng2-materials** => major code source where I use heavily because this is mostly matured comparing with others
